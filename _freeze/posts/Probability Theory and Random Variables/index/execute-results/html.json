There are two different types of probability distributions: discrete and continuous. \n\n**Discrete Distributions**\n\nDiscrete distributions are when the outcomes are finite like heads or tails of a coin. A Bernoulli distribution is an example of a discrete distribution where there are only 2 potential outcomes. The probability mass function of a Bernoulli distribution of a fair coin flip is P(x) = {0.5 if x = heads, 0.5 if x = tails}. \n\n**Continous Distributions**\n\nContinuous distributions have infinitely many outcomes, for example heights. One well known continuous distribution is the normal distribution which can be visualized with the bell curve.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUnlike discrete distributions where the value of the probability mass function at $x$ is the probability of of $x$, in the continuous distribution since there are infinitely many outcomes the probability of X = $x$ is actually 0. All of our probabilities must sum to 1, when looking at the normal distribution curve that means that the area under the curve must also be 1. So instead of using a summation, we look at intervals in the continous case.\n\n![](integral.png)\n\nSo instead of looking at the probability of an event at a specific value which we now know is 0, we can use ranges of X and calculate the area under the curve for those ranges to find meaningful probabilities in the continuous case. We can use something called the cumulative distribution function which takes the probability density function we saw above and calculates the area under the curve to the left of $x$. This is what the CDF of the normal distribution looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we can see probabilities much easier such as P($x$ < -3) is nearly 0 and P($x$ < 3) is nearly 1. \n\n**Conditional Probability Distributions**\n\n\n\n**Bayesian Probability and Bayes' Rule**\n\nA well known probability philosophy is **Bayesian Probability**. Unlike an objective perspective where known beliefs are used, a subjective perspective where the observer's own learnings and experience are used, Bayesian probability combines prior beliefs with observations. We can use Bayes' Rule to calculate our probabilities.\n\n",
